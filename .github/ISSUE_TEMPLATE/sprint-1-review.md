**Sprint Goals:**
- Become familiar with the source code of MASC-Barebones
- Produce a high-level architecture diagram that expresses how the various components of MASC-Barebone interact
- Assess the architecture.  Determine if it makes sense and if it follows the paper.
- Start improving the documentation
- Begin cleaning irrelevant and unused code
- Setup a GitHub workflow

**Progress:**
- All team members familiar with MASC-Barebones
- Logistical Milestones
    - Intelli J installed on all team machines
    - Members can pull, push, and commit to GitHub
- High-Level architecture diagram produced
- MASC architecture reviewed and discussed with team
  - Consensus is that it is clear and follows paper
- Setup.md file created detailing how to setup and run masc-core using Intelli J (Can be modified to a broader scope in future)
- Examples of irrelevant and unused code identified    
- Basic .yml file created for GitHub workflow, work is incomplete

**Challenges:**
- Initially many members had issues setting up the project in Intelli J
- Issues between the interaction of Intelli J and GitHub
- The .properties files have hardcoded directories in them, this caused some issues after pushing and pulling
- Understanding the terms Makers, Builders, and Operators and the differences between them
- Using or configuring the .yml file after it was added to the repository

**Solutions:**
- Team meetings to resolve misunderstandings and issues
- Trouble shooting the Intelli J IDE
- Deleting and re-installing the project to resolve configuration issues in Intelli J (also become more familiar with setup process)

**Future Goals:**
- Add details to and strengthen the high-level architecture diagram
- Configure the GitHub workflow and get it working on the remote repository
- Add a system to ignore changes in the .properties files until we can create a more permanent solution (dynamic file generation)
- Remove files identified as redundant or unnecessary
- Remove commented out code identified in some files
- Familiarize ourselves with the testcases and get them running on local machines
- Investigate web development with Flask and python
- Consider roles to assignment to team members
  - Some will work more with front-end UI others with the backend merging of the three disparate projects
